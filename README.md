# Image-Classification

üñºÔ∏è Image Classification Project with Machine Learning ü§ñ

This GitHub repository is a comprehensive resource for building, training, and deploying models that can accurately classify images across various categories.

üîç Key Components:

-Dataset Exploration: Explore diverse image datasets, gaining insights into the distribution of classes and the challenges posed by different types of visual data.

-Model Architecture: Discover state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other architectures employed for image classification. Experiment with pre-trained models for rapid 
                     deployment or train from scratch for specialized tasks.
                     
-Transfer Learning: Leverage the power of transfer learning to adapt pre-trained models to new image classification tasks efficiently, even with limited data.

-Evaluation Metrics: Understand the metrics used to assess model performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
